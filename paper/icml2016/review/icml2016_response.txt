Structured sparsity penalties have successfully incorporated domain knowledge into otherwise ill-posed high-dimensional predictions, whereas *hierarchical* structure sparsity has been introduced only recently (Jenatton et al., 2012 SIAM). Model regularization by hierarchical structured sparsity penalization is able to bias model selection by imposing mutual dependencies between a-priori known, overlapping compartments in the input data. This technical improvement is a watershed event for the imaging neurosciences that perform classification and regression based on the >100,000 variables per brain scan. It is so important because relevant structure in brain data has long been investigated according to two separate organizational principles: functional segregation into discrete brain regions (Passingham et al., 2002 Nature Neuroscience) and functional integration by brain networks regrouping separate regions (Sporns, 2014 Nature Neuroscience). Both organizational principles are however inextricable because a given brain region communicates input and output with
other regions and a given brain network subserves complex function by orchestrating its region nodes. This neurobiological reality suggests hierarchical statistical models as an under-exploited opportunity for neuroimaging analysis. Probably for the first time, established neurobiological knowledge of both regions and networks can thus be formally imposed onto high-dimensional model estimations.

In the present proof-of-concept study, hierarchical region-network sparsity was demonstrated to improve 1) out-of-sample performance, 2) sample complexity, and 3) domain interpretability.
First, in an 18-class prediction setting hierarchical region-network sparsity priors for logistic regression achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 95 and a classification accuracy of 90% and thus outcompeted established alternative sparsity penalties based on two separate performance metrics. Importantly, this is better than introducing only region priors (without existing network knowledge) by sparse group sparsity (AUC 94 and 88% prediction accuracy on unseen data) and group sparsity (AUC 85 and 88% accuracy). Hierarchical tree sparsity further outperformed trace-norm sparsity (AUC 91, 89%) as well as unstructured Lasso (AUC 94, 89%) and Elastic-net (AUC 94, 88%) estimators.
Second, the sample complexity was quantified by comparison of hierarchical-tree-penalized versus l1-norm-penalized logistic regression. Each model was fitted on 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the training data. Based on 20% train set, region-network-informed versus non-neurobiology-informed classification achieved 89% versus 84% accuracy (besides low versus high model variance), and 90% versus 89% on all training samples. The support recovery by computed Pearson correlation between vectors of the z-scored model coefficients.
Hierarchical penalized achieved almost identical recovery (r=0.17) with hierarchical sparsity as neurobiology-naive sparsity with 100% of the training data (r=0.18).
Third, the model interpretability was also improved because hierarchical sparsity penalization even achieved r=0.32 support recovery with 100% training data, almost twice the result from ordinary Lasso, thus effectively extracting neurobiological structure in the data-rich scenario.

Taken together, hierarchical region-network sparsity
has bridged two levels of brain architecture 
that have almost exclusively been studied separately in the neurosciences. Neuroimaging data has indeed been shown to exhibit low effective dimensionality (Bzdok et al., 2015 NIPS). Yet, it is the present experiments that demonstrate simultaneous exploitation of local region compartments and global network compartments as superior to relying on only one of these two structural priors to tackle the curse of dimensionality in a large reference dataset (international Human Connectome consortium). In the future, benefitting from neuroscience-specific estimators with combined region-network priors can enhance estimating, reproducing, and interpreting high-dimensional brain imaging analyses.
